# Bitcoin Ticker (Swift)

* This project is part of my journey in learning how to code in Swift based on the [Blockchain API](https://www.blockchain.com/api/)
* The lesson covers various topics including handling APIs and cocoa libraries like Moya, Alamofire and Object Mapper
* This app is for the purpose of self-study only so that I can broaden my knowledge more with APIs
